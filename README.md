# Gecko-Hunt
A vast reimagining and improvement to Wystan/Melix's previous game on Scratch, Gecko Run. The final game will be a question-answer game, like Kahoot or Gimkit, where you are a hunter and you need to survive for as long as possible by eating food, avoiding trees and thorn bushes, and shooting mutant geckos and fire-breathing serpents!

Developed by Wystan and Kevin/Tophat for their Computer Science 3 end-of-year project.
